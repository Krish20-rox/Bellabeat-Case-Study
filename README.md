# Bellabeat-Case-Study
In my first analysis project, I have analysed fitness tracker data taken from Kaggle, uploaded by Mobius. Analysis has been undertaken by assigning two different Bellabeat products: Time and Leaf Urban randomly as per their User Id. The data used is not the actual readings from the said products.

The data contains information on Steps, Calories, Sedentary Hours and Active Minutes for different users given by a unique Id.

I have plotted a series of visualisations to establish relationship between usage of products by users based on product(Time and Leaf Urban) and the aforementioned metrics(Steps, Calories, Sedentary Hours and Active Minutes).
